                    <h2>I like that the website indicates how it wants the viewer to interact with the website, by telling the viewer to scroll. As well as how the photos are black and white until the user hovers over it. <br> I also liked how the creaters of this website kept the color scheme simple, foucusing instead on the content and design of the website. The content was easy to understand in the way that it's layed out.</h2>

                    <h2>I love all of the small animations on the home screen. The header color for the header above the nav menu, to  be either a light or dark color, like a dark blue. I wish that there was more indications on how the viewer needs to interact with the page to reveal more content. I don't think that the tan and grey background colors go well with each other, could be fixed by either keeping one of the colors and adding a different contrasting one or just making everything have the same background color. </h2>

                    <h2>I like the little animation that reacts to the hovering of the mouse. The background color is a little to light and might be harder to read, espesully on older screens. But I do like the blue on the type and side-bar. I also like how the background colors and text colors change on some screens as the viewer scrolls.</h2>

                    <h2>I love how this website balences animation, readability of type, and story telling in this design. The social bar is a little to pormitnet in the design, because the site is mainly using the grey-scale and black and white, but the Like and Share buttons are bright blue, which draws the viewers eyes away from the content of the website. It would be fine if it was only used on the bottom and top parts of the website or if it appered when the user scrolled up instead of down in the main part of the website.</h2>

The images on the front page looks a little hapzard in the placement. I don't like how the images overlap the text, it makes it a little hard to read. The colors that the designer go really well togeather.</h2>
