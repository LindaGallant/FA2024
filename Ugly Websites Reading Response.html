            <h4 style="font-family:Segoe UI; font-size:25px; color:darkolivegreen"> It was interesting to find out that the reason that 'ugly' websites sell better was that while a website might be <br> pretty or cool it doesn't always work and can be slow to load because of all of the elements, especially if it has <br> so kind of animation. The best kind of website is one that is simple with fewer elements and little to no animation. </h4> 
            <h4 style="font-family: Lucida Sans; font-size:25px; color:rgb(46, 172, 172)"> The article also said that there's an uptick in images with types that don't match what the website is about or trying <br> to sell. If the website isn't selling something or if it's meant to be more of an artist page or blog it would be fine, but <br> if the sole purpose of the website is to sell something and it putting all of its effort into how the website looks without taking <br>into consideration how the website works, than that's were it can become a problem.</h4>
            <h4 style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:25px; color:rgb(116, 63, 165)"> It also said that when the design of a website is taking how a website looks over the functionality of the <br> website, it becomes a problem when new designers and clients think that all websites should look like that.  </h4>
            <h4 style="font-family: Verdana; font-size:25px; color:rgb(141, 15, 15)">I liked how the article showed why some of the designs wouldn't work, they didn't just say why <br> the design wouldn't work, they also showed how to fix it.</h4>
