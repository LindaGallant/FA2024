                    <p> Surface runoff is precipitation that runs off the landscape
                        The oceans are kept full by precipitation and also by runoff and discharge from rivers and the ground. <br> A simple way to put it is: precipitation falls on the land, flows overland (runoff), and runs into rivers, which then empty into the oceans.</p>
