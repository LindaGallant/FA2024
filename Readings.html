        <h1 style="color:blue; font-family: Cam; font-size: 100px;"> Clean, Neumorphism Design Trends in 2024</h1> 

        <h6 style="color:black; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 50px;"> I don't like the flat designs that are asocated with this design style, because it looks more like a coorprate design style that look more at home in a businuess or retail setting than in an app that targets consumers. But I did like the drop shadows that were added to things like buttons and settings opptions. <br> <br>
        I also didn't like the more monochormatic color scheme in the example that was shown of what Neumorphism Design looks like. But the way they only used darker shades of the same colors used to show shadows and depths. <br> <br>
    It also said that unless it's done right, this design can be very unaccessable because of the limited color and definition of things like buttons. Overall I really don't like this design trend, but if clean and miniamilistic design is done correctly with accessiblity in mind, I don't think I'd mind this style as much.  </h6>
