        <header> Intro</header>
            <p>It was intresting how the writer compareds economics to digital information, but the economics in realtion to the buying and selling part of the internet would sort of apply to the current stage of how we define economics. However, how the writier is writing is confusing </p>
        <header> Change</header>
            <p> I do agree that how we view an understand economics is every changing, however the writer could have picked a better way to explain that in a shorter paragraph.</p>
        <header>Hope</header>
            <p>The first analogy made more sense than this one did.</p>

            <p>This entire page was hard to read and understand what the author was trying to convey. It seemed that the author was talking in circles rather than getting stright to the point of their article. For me at lest, it could have been hard to read because of the font they used as well as the size of the font, but that could be fixed by using a less thiner font and upping the fonts size. </p>
